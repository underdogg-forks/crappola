Update
======

.. Note:: We recommend backing up your database before updating the app.

To update the app you just need to copy over the latest code. The app tracks the current version in a file called version.txt, if it notices a change it loads ``/update`` to run the database migrations.

If the auto-update fails you can manually run the update with the following commands. Once completed add ``?clear_cache=true`` to the end of the URL to clear the application cache.

.. code-block:: shell

   composer dump-autoload --optimize
   php artisan optimize --force
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed --class=UpdateSeeder

Weâ€™ve seen some updates fail when moving the app to a new server because the MySQL default storage engine has changed with MySQL 5.7. If you see ``SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1215`` error you may be able to fix it by running this `SQL query <https://www.invoiceninja.com/forums/topic/problem-with-new-install/#post-5313>`_
